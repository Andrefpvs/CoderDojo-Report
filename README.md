# CoderDojo-Report
My report on my tutoring activities at CoderDojo, a global volunteer-led community of free programming lessons for young people (https://coderdojo.com/)

The reports are written in Portuguese (as the activity took place in Portugal), with a focus on activities, learnings, and soft-skills.
